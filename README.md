## Overview

While modern language models (LLMs) display remarkable fluency, it remains unclear whether they acquire a consistent, human-like understanding of complex linguistic phenomena. **AnaphoraGym** investigates this question through the lens of **anaphora resolution**—a core linguistic challenge that requires deep integration of syntax, context, and world knowledge.

### Research Approach

Our methodology employs a dual-phase approach:

1. **Behavioral Assessment**: Quantify model performance using conditional log-likelihood comparisons between competing linguistic interpretations
2. **Mechanistic Analysis**: Explain behavioral findings using Patchscopes, a causal intervention technique that decodes model internal representations

### Key Questions

- Do language models systematically succeed or fail on specific anaphora resolution patterns?
- How do model scale, architecture, and training affect anaphora resolution capabilities?
- What are the mechanistic explanations for observed behavioral patterns?

## Features

- 🎯 **Comprehensive Benchmark**: Systematic evaluation across multiple anaphora resolution conditions
- 📊 **Behavioral Analysis**: Log-likelihood based assessment framework
- 🔬 **Mechanistic Interpretability**: Patchscopes-based analysis of model internals
- 📈 **Visualization Tools**: Publication-ready charts and comparisons
- 🧩 **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of experiments, analysis, and visualization
- 🔄 **Reproducible**: Well-documented pipeline with shared utilities

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- CUDA-capable GPU (recommended for large models)
- 20+ GB RAM (for large models)

### Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DuaaAlshareef/AnaphoraGym.git
   cd AnaphoraGym
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Install additional dependencies for model evaluation**
   ```bash
   pip install torch transformers accelerate
   ```

5. **Set up Hugging Face authentication** (for gated models)
   ```bash
   # Create a .env file in the project root
   echo "HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN=your_token_here" > .env
   ```

## Quick Start

### Run a Single Model Assessment

```bash
python scripts/targeted_assessment/experiments/run_experiment.py --model "gpt2"
```

### Run Full Pipeline

```bash
# 1. Configure models in scripts/targeted_assessment/run_all.sh
# 2. Run the complete pipeline
bash scripts/targeted_assessment/run_all.sh
```

## Usage

### Behavioral Assessment

The behavioral assessment evaluates models by comparing log-likelihoods of competing linguistic interpretations.

#### Single Model Evaluation

```bash
python scripts/targeted_assessment/experiments/run_experiment.py \
    --model "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf"
```

#### Batch Evaluation

1. Edit `scripts/targeted_assessment/run_all.sh`:
   ```bash
   MODELS_TO_TEST=(
     "gpt2"
     "gpt2-medium"
     "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf"
   )
   ```

2. Run the pipeline:
   ```bash
   bash scripts/targeted_assessment/run_all.sh
   ```

#### Analysis and Visualization

After running experiments, generate summaries and visualizations:

```bash
# Aggregate results across all models
python scripts/targeted_assessment/analysis/aggregate_results.py

# Create comparison charts
python scripts/targeted_assessment/visualization/create_bar_chart.py
python scripts/targeted_assessment/visualization/create_faceted_chart.py
python scripts/targeted_assessment/visualization/create_heatmap.py

# Compare model types
python scripts/targeted_assessment/analysis/compare_model_types.py
python scripts/targeted_assessment/visualization/create_comparison_charts.py
```

#### Data Processing

```bash
# Concatenate all model results
python scripts/targeted_assessment/data/concatenate_results.py

# Create enriched dataset with metrics
python scripts/targeted_assessment/data/create_enriched_dataset.py
```

### Mechanistic Analysis

The mechanistic analysis uses Patchscopes to investigate model internal representations.

```bash
# Configure parameters in scripts/mechanistic_analysis/run_patchscopes_analysis.sh
# Then run:
bash scripts/mechanistic_analysis/run_patchscopes_analysis.sh
```
